		<content>This version adds rotation support for the wall-hung paintings.
If you have added custom images to the random wall-art you will need to add the east/west/south textures for the rotation to work. 
There are a template in the Source-folder in the GitHub-project linked from the mod-page. 
There is also two bimp-templates for automating this using the BIMP plugin for GIMP: https://alessandrofrancesconi.it/projects/bimp
For support you can always ask on the Discord-server linked on the mod-page.</content>
