Hi, if you're here to edit/add some art:
There is a template next to this text file
Open it (I use paint.net)
Now, remove the text I've written there and draw/add a photo you want.
When you're done, put the file in the "Painting" folder and name it 'Painting'and some number in parenthesis
Ex: Painting (45).png
Then you're done, should be working!
